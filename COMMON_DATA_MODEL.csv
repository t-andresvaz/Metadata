"type","Yes","TYPE OF BIRTH
Birth with type of birth not known should be transmitted to EUROCAT, but will be excluded from routine EUROCAT analysis.

3) may be reported to EUROCAT but will not be included in prevalence data.
The distinction between stillbirth and spontaneous abortion should follow the definitions in use in your country (to be specified in your Registry Description).  There is usually a lower gestational age limit or birthweight limit for stillbirths.  This varies from country to country.  Below this limit fetal deaths are called spontaneous abortions.
Terminations of pregnancy refer to cases where prenatal diagnosis was made of malformation in a live fetus and the pregnancy was then terminated.  If the fetus died spontaneously in utero either before or after prenatal diagnosis of malformation then it should be coded as spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, not as termination of pregnancy.  If a termination was performed for other reasons than malformation, the case should not be transmitted to Central Registry.  This means that early terminations where there was no suspicion of malformation before termination should be excluded from the case files.
Stillbirths or perinatal deaths resulting from termination of pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis must be coded as terminations (value = 4), irrespective of civil registration status.

When each anomaly was first diagnosed.
The basis for this variable is to record whether the prenatal findings strongly suggest the postnatal diagnosis. This variable is not designed for fetal medicine specialists to assess the accuracy of their prenatal diagnosis. Thus the finding of a significant heart anomaly prenatally is considered to be prenatally detected, even if the exact anomaly was not correctly diagnosed. ‘Yes, prenatally diagnosed’, should be used when the prenatal finding is nearly 100% predictive of the congenital anomaly. ‘Partially’ means that the prenatal finding is consistent with the postnatal anomaly but has a lesser predictive value, being suggestive of more than one type of anomaly, an example here would be increased nuchal translucency.

This variable is specifically for pregestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is dealt with under the ‘illness during pregnancy’ variable (variable 64)
Type 1 diabetes: characterized by hyperglycemia due to an absolute deficiency of the insulin hormone produced by the pancreas
An HbA1c of 48mmol/mol is recommended as the cut-off point for diagnosing diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes: characterized by hyperglycemia due to a defect in insulin secretion
An HbA1c of 48mmol/mol is recommended as the cut-off point for diagnosing diabetes.
*Maturity Onset Diabetes in the Young (MODY) displays an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance
An HbA1c of 48mmol/mol is recommended as the cut-off point for diagnosing diabetes.
Impaired Glucose Intolerance is a state of higher than normal blood (or plasma) glucose concentration, but less than the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes. Diagnosed before pregnancy.

“Yes” means that the data sources clearly state that medication was taken in the first trimester. “No” means that the data sources clearly state that no medication was taken in the first trimester.
“Undetermined” means that the usual data sources were consulted, but
 it was not clearly stated that medication was either taken or not taken
 the information regarding medication use was illegible
 Type of medication is unknown.
“Medication taken but timing unknown” means that the usual data sources stated that medication was taken but the timing of use was not stated for some or all of the medications.
Use this option also for cases in which the data sources clearly state that certain medication was taken in the first trimester, but for other medication the timing was unknown. Use SP_DRUGS fields to explain for each recorded medication whether it was taken in the first trimester, or if timing was unknown.
“Not Known” means that the usual data sources were not found.
Only fill in DRUGS1-5 and EXTRADRUGS if you have coded FIRSTTRI = 1 (Yes medication taken) or = 4 (Medication taken, but timing unknown).
If you have coded FIRSTTRI = 2 (no medication taken), FIRSTTRI = 3 (undetermined) or FIRSTTRI = 9 (unknown), there shouldn’t be any ATC codes in any of the DRUGS variables
 Include any medication that was taken by the mother during the first trimester of pregnancy (from the 1st day of the last menstrual period up to the 12th week of gestation). Medication with long elimination half time and taken before conception should be included (eg. Acitretin, Etretinate, etc.).
 Use of folic acid (either as folic acid only tablets or a multivitamin preparation which contains folic acid) should be registered in the folic acid variable
 Do not include usual vitamins and mineral supplementation, but include unusual intakes of vitamins or minerals (eg. Vitamin A mega doses).
 Only medication taken at physiologic doses should be included.
